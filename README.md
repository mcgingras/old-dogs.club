### What
"You can, at any time, for very little money and relatively little effort, stand up a tiny digital community that basically belongs to itself." - paul ford
theres more to be said about the joy of launching a tiny tiny ec2 instance to make websites with your friends, but this is it. 

### How
If anybody is actually reading this and wants an account to help make super cool websites and do other fun stuff, email me at mcg79@cornell.edu

### Why
This seems like a great way to get better at sysadmin stuff, linux stuff, and it is wildly amusing.
